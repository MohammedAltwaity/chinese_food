This project is based on educational purposes and academic research driven,
The core idea, is that how we can analyze and capture a face using Raspi Camera (can be any camera) to run automated AI facial recognition on multiple websites until we get a hit, a recurssive
automated search will start and keep on searching until we find a hit.

This project, can be implemented in RTL Camera's or security cameras later on.

This is an adapted project, all the automation of the websites are made under the umbrella of educational research, no API's keys we're needed or API's calls were introduced to automate the search
rather than, the automation of the websites are an adaption and a free to use method.
