### üéØ Project Overview
**Automated Facial Search** is an educational, research-driven project that explores how to **capture a face** (using a **Raspberry Pi camera** or any compatible camera) and run **automated facial-matching searches** across multiple target websites.  
The system performs **recursive automated searches** until a match (‚Äúhit‚Äù) is found, demonstrating **automation**, **computer-vision workflows**, and **AI integration** in a controlled, academic setting.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Responsible Use:**  
> This project is intended for **research, learning, and lawful purposes only**.  
> Misuse (e.g., unauthorized surveillance, stalking, privacy invasion, or violating website terms of service) is **strictly prohibited**.  
> Always obtain necessary legal permissions and comply with privacy and data-protection laws.

## üîë Key Concepts
-  **Face Capture** ‚Äî Acquire facial images using a Raspberry Pi camera (or any supported camera).  
-  **Local Facial Recognition** ‚Äî Perform model-based matching locally without relying on external APIs.  
-  **Automated Searching** ‚Äî Automate browser interactions to find matches recursively.  
-  **Adaptable Hardware** ‚Äî Extend functionality to RTL or security cameras for approved research.

---

## ‚ú® Features
-  Camera integration for **real-time** or **batch image capture**.  
- üîç **Local face detection and recognition** pipeline ‚Äî *no external API keys required*.  
-  Automated **website traversal and matching search** logic.  
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully **modular and research-oriented** design for extensibility.

##  Getting Started (Quick Setup)


### üß∞ Requirements
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi + Camera Module (or any USB/RTSP camera)  
- **Software:** Python 3.x, OpenCV, `face-recognition`, Selenium or Playwright  

### üì¶ Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python face-recognition selenium

### Usage

Capture images: Use the included script to capture facial samples.

Run search automation: Execute the automation module to begin recursive website searches.

Explore docs: See the docs/ folder for setup, configuration, and model tuning.
