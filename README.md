Automated Facial Search (Educational Research)

Automated Facial Search is an educational, research-driven project that explores how to capture a face (using a Raspberry Pi camera or any compatible camera) and run automated facial-matching searches across multiple target websites. The system performs recursive automated searches until a match (“hit”) is found. The project demonstrates automation techniques, computer-vision workflows, and integration strategies in a controlled, academic setting.

⚠️ Important — Responsible Use: This project is intended for research, learning, and lawful uses only. Misuse (unauthorized surveillance, stalking, privacy invasion, or circumventing website terms of service) may be illegal and unethical. Before using or deploying this software, obtain all necessary legal permissions and ensure compliance with privacy laws and the policies of target websites.

Key Concepts

Face capture — Acquire facial images using a Raspberry Pi camera (or other cameras).

Local facial recognition — Run model-based facial matching locally (no external APIs required).

Automated searching — Programmatically automate interactions with websites to look for matching faces; searches continue recursively until a hit is found.

Adaptable hardware — Can be extended to work with RTL cameras or other security cameras for experiments (with appropriate permissions).

Features

Camera integration for real-time or batch image capture.

Local face detection and matching pipeline — no external API keys required.

Automated browser/scripted website traversal to attempt matches.

Designed for research and learning (modular and adaptable).

Getting Started (quick)

Hardware: Raspberry Pi with camera module (or any USB/RTSP camera).

Software: Python 3.x, OpenCV, dlib/face-recognition (or your chosen face model), and automation tooling (e.g., Selenium, Playwright, or headless browser scripts).

Install deps (example):

pip install opencv-python face-recognition selenium


Capture images: Use the included capture script to generate a local dataset.

Run search automation: Start the automation module to begin recursive site searches (see docs/ or scripts/ for specifics).

See the docs/ folder for detailed setup and configuration (camera setup, model selection, automation scripts, and runtime flags).
